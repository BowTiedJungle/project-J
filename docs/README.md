# project-J


## Overview
Project J is a jungle-native project seeking to allow NFT-verified proof of jungle membership. This jungle membership will then provide access to private resources such as a jungle wiki, forums, shitpost hall of fame, or whatever else we want to add to it. Deployment will occur in two phases. Phase 1 will be governed by trusted jungle members. All funds will be behind a multisig. Phase 2 will move to DAO governance of the Project J protocol.
